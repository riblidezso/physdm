# 08 Neural networks lab exercises

1. Use the linear perceptron model with default settings in sklearn on the titanic data. 
Evaluate the results with ROC curve and AUC using 80-20% random split with random_state=0. 
2. Use the multi-layer perceptron model with default settings in sklearn on the titanic data. 
Evaluate the results with ROC curve and AUC using 80-20% random split with random_state=0. 
3. Implement and train the same model as in exercise 2 using keras instead of scikit-learn.
Evaluate the results with ROC curve and AUC using 80-20% random split with random_state=0. 
4. Load the MNIST hadwritten digit dataset using Keras. Train a neural network of your choice in the hidden layers. 
Evaluate the results with accuracy using the original train/test split. Compare your result to a random forest with 100 trees, how good is your result?
5. Implement the perceptron model using only numpy.
